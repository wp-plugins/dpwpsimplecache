== Description ==

D(ifferent)P(lace) Simple Cache is a WordPress plugin to implement a simple cache of objects at session level.

dpwpsimplecache provides a global variable $dpcache, which is an instantiation of the class DP_Cache already set up to talk to the $_SESSION. Always use the global $dpcache variable (Remember to globalize $dpcache before using it in any custom functions). 

If you don't want to track sessions into db set the $USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER global variable to 0

	`global $USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER;`
	`$USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER = 0; // default 1`

Insert object;

	`$dpcache->set($key,$object);`
	
Get object:

	`$object = $dpcache->set($key);`
	
Count active users:

	`$count_users = $dpcache->get_sessions_number();`
	
Count objects in the current user's $_SESSION:

	`$dpcache->get_statistics();`
	
Get all objects in the current user's $_SESSION:

	`$dpcache->get_all_values();`
	
Test if an object exist in the current user's $_SESSION:

	`$dpcache->contais($key);`
	
Delete all objects. If the $all parameter is set to false the method delete only the current user's $_SESSION, if true truncate the entire table (default false):

	`$dpcache->flush();`
	
Prints human-readable information about all objects:

	`$dpcache->inspect();`
	
Delete an object in the current user's $_SESSION:

	`$dpcache->delete($key);`
	
At any time, through the administrative page, you can:

* see all objects in the current user cache
* delete all objects in the current user cache
